The title of this blog is *R for the rest of us*. The phrase R has a steep learning curve is true, and I hope to assist anyone leap up to *R* from spreadsheets.

Learning *R* and basic data science has helped me wrangle nonprofit program data and develop methods to make data processing and reporting easier.  I came to *R* from a unique path--the social service sector. Currently, I use *R* to manage and automate the evaluation of [Get REAL!](http://www.fldoe.org/schools/family-community/activities-programs/mentoring_student_assistance.stml)-- a state wide mentoring program.


Currently working as the Veteran Services Contract Coordinator at the [Senior Connection Center](http://seniorconnectioncenter.org/). This positon allows me to use my unique blend of social service experience and data management skills.



## Areas of Interest:

*Youth aging out of foster care* 

I worked in the child welfare system for 7 years both as a direct service worker and in quality assurance. A great experience was working with the [*Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative*](http://www.aecf.org/work/child-welfare/jim-casey-youth-opportunities-initiative/) and serving on their self-evaluation team.
