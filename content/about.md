My name is Kevin Gilds, and I am a professional in the nonprofit sector.I have been successful at wrangling nonprofit program data and developing methods to make procesing data easier for staff. I use R and Git to manage and automate the evaluaiton of a state wide mentoring program. 


The title of this blog is *R for the rest of us*. The phrase R has a steep learning cure is true and I want to assist anyone who is attempting to leap up to the R language and feel lost.

Blog post will focus on methods in R, productivity hacks, Metallica, and other current events. 

Please feel free to reach out. 






Praying to connect with other R users and who know what Github is.
