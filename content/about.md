## Kevin Gilds, MPA

A professional in the nonprofit sector for 10 plus years. I have been successful at wrangling nonprofit program data and developing methods to make data processing and reporting easier.  

I use R and Git to manage and automate the evaluaiton of a state wide mentoring program. The title of this blog is *R for the rest of us*. The phrase R has a steep learning cure is true and I want to assist anyone who is attempting to leap up to the R language and feel lost.
