My name is Kevin Gilds, and I am a professional in the nonprofit sector. I use R and Github to manage nonprofit evaluation work. 

I have been successful at wrangling nonprofit program data to help staff and improve efficiency.   



Praying to connect with other R users and who know what Github is.
