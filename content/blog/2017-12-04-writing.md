Last week, I had a couple of hints from blog posts/podcasts that I should be writing every day. Mostly their work/art prompts makes me want to write more. 

I have been impressed with this blog by [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/) and apparently everyone has known about [Wait but why](https://waitbutwhy.com/wait-but-who)

I am determined not to code or write at night as I believe strong that impacts my sleep. 
I have been effective in getting up every morning writing code for an ongoing project and do not want to give that time up. However, I think I can divide some of this time up and still be productive.
