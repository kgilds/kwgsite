<p>rmarkdown::render(“file.name”)</p>
<p>The line of code above has dramatically improved my workflow. The render function helped me reach the goal of creating an automated system of creating a status report and share data in a more efficient manner.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I still want to use the makefile feature but this process has helped identify the structure.</p>
<p>Here is a snippet of how the automation works</p>
<p><strong>Created an Rmd file that does the following</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>reads the csv survey data files</li>
<li>creates an RDS file in the directory</li>
<li>renders the data management scripts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The data management scripts run and do the following</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the data management scripts send data to a sqlite database</li>
<li>sends data to a designated dropbox folder.</li>
<li>creates a status report on valid data entry and duplicate entries.</li>
</ul>
