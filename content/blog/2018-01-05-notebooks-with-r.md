I have been ambivalent about using the notebook feature in R studio. I test drove Jupyter Notebooks, and I did not love the experience--even using R. 

However, I have slowly been adopting notebooks into my work flow and here are my use cases for notebooks.

One benefit is testing code or troubleshooting code, I am using in a shiny application.


A second benefit, I have noted with notebooks is that when Preview is selected; the html document will generate and includes the normal output but will also show code that does not work along with the  error messages. This is has been beneficial while working through the exercises in [R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
