More on the book *Deep Work*.  Cal Newport suggest scheduling every minute of your day. 

This is challenging--it takes training and practice but it has had profound impact on my productivity and well being. 


	Everyone has a plan 'til they are punched in the mouth.--Mike Tyson 


Tasks either take longer or get completed quicker than expected thus there is a lot of adjustment to the schedule but it is well worth the effort.
