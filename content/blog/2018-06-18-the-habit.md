One day, I stopped working on the master branch and started creating new branches, committed the files, pushed the changes, merged into the master, checked back into the master to pull the content back down from the repository. One day it just became a habit.

Speaking of which--I just finished the [**The Power of Habit**](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X) by Charles Duhigg. I liked the book especially the diagrams throughout the book to model the concept and I like the application of Systems Theory. My wish is that author would reference that he was using [system theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Discipline)
