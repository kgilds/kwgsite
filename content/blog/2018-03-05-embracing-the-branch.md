I read this interesting [post](https://suzan.rbind.io/2018/03/reflections-4-months-of-github/) from Suzan Baert about getting started with Git/Github. I think recommendation 2 about using a dummy repo to experiment with is key and I would recommend this approach to my younger self. My biggest issue was not having the reps and confidence.  

### One branch at a time


I have been using Git for about three or four years and just in the last month started using branches to make changes on a consistent basis. I had used branches before but only sporadically and it felt like walking on a tight rope. 

I simply needed more reps. Where I would constantly mess is up is not pulling back down after checking out a master. This led to burning down repos and other avoidance behaviors. 

Now, I visualize the interchange of the push to Github/Gitbucket and then pull back down to my computer. 



My next step is to work on two or three branches at a time--on a dummy repo of course.
