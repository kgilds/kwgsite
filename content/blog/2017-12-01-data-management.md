My intent was to build a data entry application with Python using the flask web environment. Somehow I managed to talk myself into using Shiny with the help of this [post](https://deanattali.com/2015/04/23/shinyjs-r-package/) from Dean Atalli. It only took me about a couple of distracted hours with 3 kids to get through the tutorial and a morning to update a line of code to get the example working.



The pros to this approach are the following:

1. Improve my Shiny skill Set

2. I need a small crud data entry system--not a full application framework. 

3.  This approach keeps my workflow in the R environment and I feel like I am more likely to complete the project. 


The con is that this was an opportunity to get practice and reps using Python and a popular web development. However, I think the simplicity and likelihood are greater that I can have an application up by Christmas and I am still learning some web development skills.
