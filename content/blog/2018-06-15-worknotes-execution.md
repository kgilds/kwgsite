This morning I had excellent execution of a plan. I was tempted to work on a plot that is still in development. I opted to execute my plan for today and executed it.

I played around with Gitlab issues and project management this morning--at first I hated it but it started growing on me rapidly--I started to think about moving over from bitbucket.

This afternoon and tonight, I was a bit obsessed with starting the process of modeling some sales data. I am trying to work through how to execute in code my questions about the data set. However, I was proud that I used dplyr to sample 60% of the data set for my training set. Boy is it being trained.
