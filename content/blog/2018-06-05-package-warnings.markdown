## 06/05/2018

Worked on adding specific life skills functions this morning. CMD check a couple of warnings that functions were not documented.
ran

>  devtools::doucument()

This updated Roxygen? library; maybe this is why Ctr + Shift + D did not work.

It is awesome to see your work in help files.

Received new warnings and was having a hard time sorting it out

It says df is not defined?

I wonder if referencing other code gives me this error

>  Functions with \usage entries need to have the appropriate \alias entries, and all their arguments documented. The \usage entries must correspond to syntactically valid R code.
