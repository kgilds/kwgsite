I came across this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-leaders-there-are-too-many-of-you-37bff8088505) on twitter tonight. 

I don't know that I have the expertise to concur or disagree with this article--I mean the premise is correct being able to solve business problems seems like a 'no-brainer'. 

Another important skill is political skills. Sometimes you see what others do not see and you have to sell the vision to the right people.
