I was happy to learn that updating a R-package is easy; at least my update this morning was painless. The first time I worked on a package it felt awful. 

This morning I worked to fix some issues. I made the necessary changes and re-built the package with ease. Cleaned up the rest of the report; wiped out unnecessary chunks and merged back in with master. 

I notice when working with bookdown a lot of files change when you preview. This has promoted me to start using this git technique. 


```r
git commit -a -m"message"
