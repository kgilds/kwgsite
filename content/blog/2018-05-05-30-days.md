One of my favorite non-R bloggers to follow is [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/newsletter/). What I love about his blog is that he talks about the craft of writing and being an artist. He has a rule about writing every day. 

My writing skill has decreased over the past couple of years; but I suspect it mostly has to with the lack of writing. 

It has been a month since my last blog post; my challenge will be to post everyday for 30 days.

Who knows, maybe it will become a habit.
