I started working on upgrading a markdown report this morning using ` r forcats` and ` r janitor`. Like other renovations this turned into a complete overhaul and did not even get to the fun stuff. 

I had to dig into ` rreadr` to update many of the columns to factors. One thing to recall is to knit rather than relying on re-running chunks--there seems to be something about starting fresh.

Typically investments like these payoff in the long run.
