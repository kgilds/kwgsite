I started the practice of meditating about 2 months ago. I am proud of myself for sticking to it. Some days are better than others but the key is learning that the rep or value is learning to recognize your thoughts have drifted and to come back. 

Meditation is not a cure all but it does help you get out of a bad mental state quicker.
