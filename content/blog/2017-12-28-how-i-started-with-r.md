Yesterday, I was reading a thread on the R-Studio Community about how to convince colleagues to switch from Excel to R. It made me think about what prompted me to make the switch. I am not sure there is anything worse than analyzing survey data in Excel. 


In July of 2011 I started a job at a nonprofit organization as a Quality Assurance Coordinator. My main duty was to develop surveys that measured customer satisfaction and program quality. The organization had a license for SPSS; however, the challenge was that SPSS and the license were locked down on a worthless laptop. The cost to re-license SPSS was in the thousands and obtaining a new license was not worth the investment. This started my quest for alternatives to high priced statistical software and I recall downloading R and not having the slightest idea on how to even get started. 

Finally in 2012, I received training in R from a Intro to Statistics course on Coursera. The learning process was terribly awkward, and I am not sure how I fell in love with R or why I continued. What did take hold was the Data Analysis course from the folks at Simply Statistics.
