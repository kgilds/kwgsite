On May 5th I made a commitment to post everyday to this blog for 30 days. I fulfilled this promise. Posting every day is playing the long game because the short game has been ugly. 

### The Ugly

I have been stretching for content and my content was not always R related. Because my content was not always R related that got me kicked off of the live updates for R-weekly. This in turn has decreased my readership. I worry that the effort to post everyday inhibited more in-depth posts. 

### The Long Haul
I don't always want to write about R; I like to write about management, leadership and the nonprofit sector. My sense is that I need to write everyday in order to make the more in-depth posts even better. When I have a beneficial post to share on R; I will share it.
