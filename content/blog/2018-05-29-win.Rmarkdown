This weekend I was creating some plots and was pleased that I was purposeful with the plotting arguments rather than copying other code and hoping it turns out the way I want. 

The book [R For Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a great way to learn the fundamentals. 

My next challenge is incorporating the scales argument to render the percent sign.
