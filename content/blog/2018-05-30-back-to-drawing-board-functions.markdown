I was working through some code this weekend and used one of my former [post](http://kgilds.rbind.io/2018/05/07/developing-my-functions/). Yikes, it did not work. Did I just imagine it worked prior?

I need to work through this [page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/programming.html)
