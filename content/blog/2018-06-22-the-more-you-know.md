I am currently reading [*Weapons of Math Destruction*](https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/). I had heard about the book prior and had some reservations, and when I picked it up at the library; I still had a tinge of hesitation. I think my understanding was that this was an anti-data book and this is not the case.  

The author Cathy O' Neil emphasizes what I strongly believe and that is models and data should be transparent. She uses baseball as a prime example of an open and transparent system and where the model adjusts as new outcomes emerge. She contrasts this with models that are not transparent and do not receive adequate feedback about it's predictions and this is what she refers to as Weapons of Math Destruction.  


I am glad I read it, it is easy to understand and useful.
