This morning, I worked on getreal2 package and was able test the package in the real world.

The warnings from yesterday were able to be addressed.

The param tag needed needed to have the df param right after it. For some reason, I just had dots.

I deleted the \code{function} reference to other functions in the documentation section.

The only concern testing in the real world is that succcess_c did not load in current version of package. Another concern is that I need to think about the name of the variables; they seem to be the name of the functions which I am not jazzed about.

Tommorrow work on the academic enagement functions--start out in the report enviornment

> Approx 80 minutes.
