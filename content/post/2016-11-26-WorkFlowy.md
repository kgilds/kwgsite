I manage nonprofit evaluation projects with Github, Trello, Slack and WorkFlowy. Github and Trello are more for Task managment and there is some redundancy to the process but I make every attempt to integrate these tools.

What I think gets lost with Github, Trello, and Slack is that it is hard to see the entire puzzle. Workflowys is a narrative of what is going on with a project. When, I complete it hides but the best part is that it is easy to bring back to see what the hell happened.
