I am enjoying this new [podcast]https://open.spotify.com/show/334O1au7TzGsZztZTrF9zj?si=318Iy3LgREWjXnOlGosYVQ from Arthur Brooks. 

The contention for Brooks is that people argue badly and that the arguments are escalating towards contempt. He points out that arguing and anger can  convey caring and can bring people closer together.

This argument feels correct to me and his podcasts have been both practical and powerful.
