This past week, I finished [*Bird by Bird*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Lamott). This book fits with the approach of the *Joy is the Playing* or in her case writing. 

This afternoon I listened to this [podcast](https://tim.blog/) with Tim Ferris and Jason Fried. The best part of the conversation pertained to the importance of writing and communicating well. Jason Fried made an asute observation that schools do not teach iteration in writing. I suspect that this is true. The books suggestion is [Revising Prose] https://www.amazon.com/Revising-Prose-5th-Richard-Lanham/dp/0321441699
