I finally started using pipes in my workflow; it took a bit to get used to but I think I finally got it. 

The pipes are this %>%; here is a link to  [Official Documentation](https://github.com/smbache/magrittr)


Here is some code that I used this weekend.

```R
langarts <- inner_join(q1_langarts, q2_langarts, by="girlCode")

dim(langarts)

langarts_1 <- langarts %>%
    select(girlCode, council.x, lang_pts, lang_pts2)

langarts_q2q1 <- langarts_1 %>%
    mutate(pt_diff = lang_pts2 - lang_pts)

```
