Friday I listen to an [R Podcast](https://www.r-podcast.org/) regarding the Shiny Developer Conference . I was pysched about performing crazy-cool Shiny App. I have been humbled.

No Shiny App emerged this weekend; however, one important things did happen.

Working through the Shiny App, I came up with an idea to attach another R programming problem.
