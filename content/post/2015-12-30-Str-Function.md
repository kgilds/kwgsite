### Str function

The str function lets you take a look at the underlying structure of your data object. This function is useful for troubleshooting. I was having fun with factors and  was able to compare my factor levels from one object to the next.

```r
str("object")
```

Using the str function I was able to see the issue and make the corrected change.
