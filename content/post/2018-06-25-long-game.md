Earlier this year, I set up an Rmd file with more functions and named the variables more general terms. Hence, I only had to change the name and path of the input file and the name of the output file. Approximately 3.5 hours of work was reduced to 50 minutes.  Ultimately, I want to see more the scripts turn into functions, Addin, or Shiny Application.
