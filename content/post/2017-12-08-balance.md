I recall walking into a college orientation and being uncertain if I was in the right room. The reason I was uncertain is because there were more parents in the room than college kids. It never occurred to me to take my parents with me to college orientation.  My bias has been that those students who brought their parents with them were doomed to failure. I suspect my bias is wrong--maybe.


Balance is key; you can either turn them out into the wild and hope for the best or provide a framework for success.
