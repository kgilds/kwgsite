My OKR for the end of July was to develop an R package for Get REAL! and complete the summative evaluation report in bookdown. 

The Get REAL! package worked like a charm; I see other additional opportunities for additional functions including for plots. 

I enjoyed working in Bookdown; my frustration was that the final report needs to be submitted in Microsoft Word. There is too much change that needs to occur between the markdown document and word. I have not figured out how to successfully render the book into a single html report.
