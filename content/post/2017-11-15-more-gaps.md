Writing this blog post on [Gaps](http://kgilds.rbind.io/2017/11/08/gaps/) inspired me to re-read parts of the *The Fifth Discipline* by Peter Senge. 

Gaps are a source of energy and Senge writes creative tension emerges from the a gap of vision and reality. He uses a rubber band to illustrate that between vision and current reality is tension and the only way to break the tension is move reality toward the vision or move the vision toward reality. 


Senge points out creative tension can result in feelings of anxiety, but it is important to distinguish between the feelings of anxiety that may be produced and the creative tension. Moving the vision closer to reality is the  danger of not distinguishing between the creative tension and emotional tension. 

The skill is to be able to carry or hold creative tension so has to move reality toward your vision; not lowering your vision to reality. 

The concept of creative tension resides with me and the challenge of managing those emotions.
I recall earlier this summer working on a project with a tight deadline that evoked creative tension and a big challenge was managing emotions that came along with the creative tension.
