I am starting on the new year of project and was revisiting some functions. I had a function that created a csv file of duplicate values for every organization that submitted data. The function was useful but a pain to run the function for every organization on separate chunks. 

I figured there had to be better way. The following is an incremental improvement to the old process but I do have a sense there is a better way.


```{r eval=FALSE}



setwd("~/getRealMY20172018/Produced_data")

pre_council_dupes <- preDupes %>%
	split.data.frame(.$council) #split the data frame into a list based on council
	


for (council in names(pre_council_dupes)){  #loop over the list based on names
	write.csv(pre_council_dupes[[council]], paste0(council,"_pre_student_dupes.csv")) #write a csv file based on pre_council_dupes object subsetted by council, paste name of council into file name  the _pre_student_dupes.csv is the rest of the file name
	
	
}

pre_council_dupes
```
```
