I finished reading *Deep Work* by Cal Newport last month. Mr. Newport puts a framework and rules to what I think we already suspect. The book made me think of two other books *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maitenance* and *The War of Art*.  Both of these books put an emphasis on the benefits of craftmanship. 


The concept of taking a break from focus rather than distraction is profound and his challenge to quit social media for 30 days benefical.
