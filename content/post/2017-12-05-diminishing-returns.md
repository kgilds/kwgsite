I listened to a bunch of podcast today but I hardly recall any points. Ok, maybe one point stuck out and that is the value of being bored--that means maybe not listening to so many podcast in short time frame. Today, the points really had no chance to stick. 


This reminds to revisit the exercise of a working meditation while commuting to work.
