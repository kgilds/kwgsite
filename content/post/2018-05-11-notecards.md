Below are the index card that kicked off my [Florida Absences Project]( https://tidydatabykwg57.shinyapps.io/flabsences/). 

On one side of the card, I write out the general objectives of what I want to accomplish and the start date and end date of the project.

The reverse is the tactical notes on the project--

I started using this process after reading Cal Newport's book [*Deep Work*](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/)

I like this process; eventually more detail gets moved to Github issues but I like starting out with the index cards and keeping a physical artifact.
