I listened to this [podcast](https://www.recode.net/2018/3/5/17078890/alexander-saint-amand-glg-gerson-lehrman-group-education-harvard-uber-kara-swisher-decode-podcast) with the GLG president--Alexander Saint-Amand and Kara Swisher. 

In this podcast, they discuss the future of education. My takeaway from the discussion is that value is found between the balance of automating and the wisdom of humans. The controversy around YouTube and advertisements on Infowars seems to be another case in point where turning your self completely to automation seems risky. 


Another, interesting discussion centered around the dynamic between teacher and students. I have found this to be true---I may be a great teacher for some and not so great for others.
