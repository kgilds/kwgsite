I was in the process of trying to burn down a git repo but after other failed attempts--I determined that I was going to have to learn what I was doing wrong.

I could not seem to conncet my new directory to my bitbucket repoistory. The problem was that I could not find or seem to create a new branch. The key is knowing that a branch can't be a branch until there is files on the branch.



Here is the [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41620735/error-src-refspec-master-does-not-match-any-when-trying-to-push-to-bitbucket-r) question and response that fixed my problem and I learned.
