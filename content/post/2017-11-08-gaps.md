I keep coming across the concept of gaps--more specifically the gap between reality and one's vision for how reality should be. I first came across this concept in the [*Fifth Discipline*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Discipline) by Peter Senge. 

Currently I am reading [*Man's Search for Meaning*] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning) by Viktor Frankl. 

This concept also came up in this interview of [Ray Dalio](https://www.recode.net/2017/11/6/16610878/bridgewater-associates-ray-dalio-book-principles-life-work-decision-formula-kara-swisher-podcast) that I listened to this week. 


Frankl argues that mental health requires tension and the essence of being a human being is to close the gap between what is and what should be. More powerfully, Frankl argues that a person needs the struggle for a worthwhile goal to find meaning in life. 

I hope my goals and struggles are worthwhile.
