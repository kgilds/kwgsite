Another theme emerging this summer is the importance of asking good questions. The theme first emerged during a leadership lunch with my organization's CEO. Currently, I am reading **Benjamin Franklin: An American Life** by Walter Isaacson. Isaacson points out the Franklin used questions to disarm others in argument. 

I had success with this approach last week, and  I hope to keep mindful of this approach.
