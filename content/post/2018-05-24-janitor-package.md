I was reviewing a markdown document and see an opportunity to incorporate tably functions from the [janitor package](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor), and  will need the [forcats package](https://github.com/tidyverse/forcats) to set up the infrastructure. 

I was able to test out the features of tably and adorn and it made me giddy.  

My confession is that I have never used the forcats package but I am excited to learn.
