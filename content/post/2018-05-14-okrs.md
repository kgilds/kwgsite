After listening to this [podcast](https://www.recode.net/2018/5/14/17350538/john-doerr-measure-what-matters-book-kleiner-perkins-okrs-kara-swisher-teddy-schleifer-podcast) with John Doerr--I am bit obsessed with OKRs. This [video](https://library.gv.com/how-google-sets-goals-okrs-a1f69b0b72c7) from Google Ventures is also insightful. 

I know my upcoming OKR is going to center around completing my next report in [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/). I was hesitant to try in February because I was not confident I could get the output to a single-word document.
