I finally did it. I bought a refrubished laptop and installed Ubuntu to run R. The only trouble I had was installing R studio. It appears there are some challenges adding outside software on this platform--Ubuntu 16.4

This article helped me throught the process [Install R, R-Studio on Ubuntu](https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-r-and-rstudio-on-ubuntu-12-04-14-04-16-04-b6b3107f7779)



The only adjustment I had to make was to change the verison number of R-Studio I was downloading. Basically you update the version number; in my case instead of downloading 1.0.44; I downloaded verision 1.1.383.  You can find the most current version of R-Studio here (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 

Thus far so good, I love it.
