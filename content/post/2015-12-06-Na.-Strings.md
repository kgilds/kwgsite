### na. strings

The argument ```na.string= ""``` saved me a lot of work today.  Happy I came across this in Stack Over Flow relatively quickly.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24172111/change-the-blank-cells-to-na.

My data set apparently has hidden spaces and  the na.omit function was not removing these observations. As a result, my factor levels were messed up and my table summaries were awful.

It is fun to learn new things.
