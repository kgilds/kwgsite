A key result from one of my [OKR's](http://kgilds.rbind.io/2018/05/14/okrs/) is to complete an evaluation report with [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/a-single-document.html). I was unsure of how to incorporate Bookdown into my workflow and determined to start a new directory but at the last minute decided to make a subproject within the larger evaluation project. I never even considered this before and it seems to be working.
