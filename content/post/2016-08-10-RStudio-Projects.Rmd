I use RStudio nearly everday and thought it may be easier to blog with R studio. After research, I realized it is easy to do with Jeykll and Github pages. 

I suspected the only change that would have to be implemented would be to use Projects in RStudio. I was hesistant to do this because I made the assumption that you had to start with a fresh (new) directory this not the case. 

The ability to blog with RStudio was the motivation to jump into Projects in R Studio and start using the RStudio Git Version control system. Thus far it has been great and I only wish I had started it sooner.
