I have been a middle manager in the social service sector for approximately 10 years. In order to manage people both staff and consumers, one has to be able to manage the influx of data that comes to you. 

The most valuable skill/practice that I have implemented is the practice of keeping tidy data sets and being able to "join" differing data sets. 

I work with spreadsheet users and I teach and preach tidy data practices all the time. Another critical aspect is teaching users how to use input controls and other data validation tools in spreadsheets to help keep the data clean. 

The payoff for tidy data practices is the ease of which a pivot table can be generated on the tidy data set. 

It's a start.
