I have been a middle manager in the social service sector for approximately 10 years. In order to manage people both staff and consumers, one has to be able to manage the influx of data that comes to you. 

The most valuable skill/practice that I have implemented is the practice of keeping tidy data sets and being able to "join" differing data sets.
