Is the cure worse than the disease is what I pondered after I fixed an issue with Disqus comments. 

I could not figure out to get the Disqus Comment section to render on this site. 

The fix for addressing the Disqus issues was changing the baseurl parameter from "/" to the name of the website in the confg.toml file. This [Github Issue](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/52) helped me resolve. 

Before 

```
baseurl= "/"
```

The fix
```
baseurl = "http://kgilds.rbind.io/"
```

However after this was fixed, images on my site would not hold steady. They image would render initially but if you clicked away and came back to the page with the image; the image would be gone. I suspect this had something to do with the relative path of the image. I made this slight adjustment to reference the image below

This is the [github issue](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/77) that helped me figure this out. 

Before
```
![luke](img/luke.jpg)
```

The fix

```
![luke](/img/luke.jpg)

```

Another issue with images I was experiencing is the orientation of the image when rendering. Although the image appeared to be a vertical image; there may be metadata in the image that will render it with a landscape orientation.

I attempted to put some html to resolve the issue like a good hacker--but did not work.

My current solution is to edit the image in google photos; rotate the image to it's side and then rotate back vertically--download again.
