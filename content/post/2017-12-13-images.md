Is the cure worse than the disease is what I pondered after I fixed an issue with Disqus comments. 

The fix for addressing the Disqus issues was changing the baseurl parameter from "/" to the name of the website. 

Before 

```
"/"
```

The fix
```
baseurl = "http://kgilds.rbind.io/"
```

However after this was fixed, images on my site would not hold steady. They would render initially but if you clicked away and came back  to the page with the image; the image would be gone. I suspect this had something to do with the relative path of the image. I made this slight adjustment to reference the image below

Before
```
![luke](img/luke.jpg)
```

The fix

```
![luke](/img/luke.jpg)

```

Another issue with images is that even though the image appear be orientated vertically; the image may render sideways depending on the meta-data of the image. 

I attempted to put some html to resolve the issue like a good hacker--but did not work.

My current solution is to edit the image in google photos; rotate the image to it's side and then rotate back vertically--download again.
