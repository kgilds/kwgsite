Is the cure worse than the disease is what I pondered after I fixed an issue with Disqus comments. 

The fix for addressing the Disqus issues was changingg the baseurl parameter from "/" to the name of the website. 

Before 

```
"/"
```

The fix
```
baseurl = "http://kgilds.rbind.io/"
```

However after this was fixed, images on my site would not hold steady. They would render initally but if you clicked away and came back  to the page with the image; the image would be gone. I suspect this had something to do with the relative path of the image. I made this slight adjustment to reference the image below

Before
```

```

The fix

```
![luke](/img/luke.jpg)

```
