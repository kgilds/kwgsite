Is the cure worse than the disease is what I pondered after I fixed an issue with Disqus comments. 

I could not figure out to get the Disqus Comment section to render on this site. 

The fix for addressing the Disqus issues was changing the baseurl parameter from "/" to the name of the website in the confg.toml file. This [Github Issue](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/52) helped me resolve. 

Before 

```
baseurl= "/"
```

The fix
```
baseurl = "http://kgilds.rbind.io/"
```

However after this was fixed, images on my site would not hold steady. The image would render initially but if you clicked away and came back to the page with the image; the image would be gone. I suspect this had something to do with the relative path of the image. I made this slight adjustment to reference the image below

This is the [github issue](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/77) that helped me figure this out. 

Before
```
![luke](img/luke.jpg)
```

The fix

```
![luke](/img/luke.jpg)

```

Another issue with images I was experiencing is the orientation of the image when rendering. Although the image appeared to be a vertical image; there may be metadata in the image that will render it with a landscape orientation. For instance, this is not how this image displays in google photos or in file directory.

Here is a discussion on 
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19434073/how-can-i-avoid-that-github-rotates-my-jpg-in-my-readme-md) about this issue. 

My initial solution is to edit the image in google photos; rotate the image to it's side and then rotate back vertically--download again. The solution presened is not ideal and not hacker enough for me.Here is a post on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46576679/jupyter-notebook-display-image-in-portrait-orientation) that helped me resolve this issue with html/css.

<img style="transform: rotate(90deg); width:500px" src="/img/cooper.jpg" alt="cooperr" title="cooper"/>

<br></br>


Here is my code to do this. I did have to add break html lines between the imae and text blocks; otherwise the image would run over the text.

```
<img style="transform: rotate(90deg); width:500px" src="/img/cooper.jpg" alt="cooperr" title="cooper"/>
