I have been a late bloomer in terms of developing my own tool box of functions and I have finally starting to see the opportunities to use functions and even to write my own packages. 

A rule of thumb is that writing a script twice means it is time to write a function; 
I managed to write a variation of the same script 6 times before it dawned on me this should be a function. 

I use this function in many of my scripts to remind me of how easy it is write your own function. 

```r
read_attendance <- function(rds) {
	 read_rds(rds)
	 
```
