I have noticed that  most my content displays quite well within the post framework for with this theme. However, at times I want to utilize the full page mode. I know how to do this but I am not positive how to make it look nice. I am going to try hack my way through this and see if I can make this work.   

I am strangely loyal to this theme; or too lazy to make a change.
