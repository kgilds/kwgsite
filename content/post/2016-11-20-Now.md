I studied sociology as an undergraduate in the 1990s. At times, the concepts of sociology seemed mysterious--almost just theoretical--Not now, the concepts of class/group conflict, legitimacy, celebrity, are crystal clear.

The time for laziness is over, history is happening and people are what shape history.

A book that I recently re-read is *Lilia* and this book is helpful in providing a theoretical framework for what is happening. It appears we are moving towards valuing biological value patterns. Here is a link to my writings about the book. <https://github.com/kgilds/Annotated/blob/master/Lilia.Rmd>

Our maybe we always were but they used social conventions to mask the underlying conflict.
