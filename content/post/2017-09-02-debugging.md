# An approach to debugging

Take the approach that most likely it is your fault that something is not working. You are simply not providing clear enough directions to the computer--Your computer is simple and has no grit to problem solve your sloppiness. 

Be thankful that that the computer is throwing an error rather giving a result that is wrong. 

My approach to debugging accounts for the following:

* Data Types
* Spaces
* Syntax Errors and missing commas
* Other silly mistakes
