This morning successfully rendered table in shiny dashboard that reflected the number of matches on the student survey. I was thinking of developing a ggplot that reflected current status and goal or prior years. I am still not jazzed about the data entry tables could you plot it? I think I tried to put the different sources in boxes but it was too much.  I am just not sure if it is worth the effort to change now.

This prompted me to review prior shiny apps and I had some beautiful. It may be worth thinking about plotting this in the report.
