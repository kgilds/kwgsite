Do you agree that good infrastructure makes your life easier? Have you thought about the infrastructure of managing your program data? What are your systems that are in place to collect, manage and analyze your data?

 My experience is that nonprofit organizations do not manage their program data in an optimal way and often manage their data in ways that make it challenging for employees to do their work. My gravest concern is that many nonprofit managers may not even recognize there is a  problem.  

Sending your staff for more spreadsheet training is not the answer. I believe we need to teach data science concepts. We can and should be teaching foundational data science; yes that means teaching coding skills to wrangle data; no we don't have to teach linear algebra and machine learning--at least not right away. 

Journalism is doing this for their profession, we should be doing the same.
I would start with sql and the concept of normal form/tidy data.
