It was a struggle for me to learn to write my own functions in R. The moment it did sink in; My though was this--this is like a Shiny Input and Output. 

My two cents is that Shiny should be introduced sooner rather than later for those beginning to learn R.The basis for my assertion is this that learning Shiny helped me conceptualize how make my own functions and  added to my computer literacy regarding web development.  

This may be a worthy approach if you are struggling with writing your own functions.
