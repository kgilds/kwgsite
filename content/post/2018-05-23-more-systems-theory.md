My [post](http://kgilds.rbind.io/2018/05/22/systems-vs-goals/) highlighted an article that encouraged one to think of systems rather than goals. Today, I heard a podcast from Seth Godin that emphasized the long term and systems.

In graduate school, I was briefly introduced to Systems Theory and subsequently read [The Fifth  Discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Discipline).  I encourage all to read this book--it will help you play the long game.
