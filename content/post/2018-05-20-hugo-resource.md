Yesterday, I was writing about making the distinction between different types of content. For instance some content is fine in the confines of a post and some content would be better filling an entire page.

I have been working through how to organize this content within the confines of my theme. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GZxidrlaRM) is useful in laying the framework to understanding how to structure and display items in the content folder. 

[Giraffe Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmINlrza7JHB1zkIOuXEbw) has some other useful tutorial videos on Hugo that have been helfpful as well.
