I came across this article on [Lifehacker]https://lifehacker.com/5903288/i-learned-to-speak-four-languages-in-a-few-years-heres-how?utm_campaign=socialflow_lifehacker_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow&utm_source=lifehacker_twitter and discovered the resource of Anki Flashcards. 

[Anki Web]https://apps.ankiweb.net/ has preloaded templates including R and statistics. 
I can sync my desktop program with an application on my phone and study R during lunch.
