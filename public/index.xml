      <description>I am starting on the new year of project and was revisiting some functions. I had a function that created a csv file of duplicate values for every organization that submitted data. The function was useful but a pain to run the function for every organization on separate chunks.
I figured there had to be better way. The following is an incremental improvement to the old process but I do have a sense there is a better way.</description>

      <description>More on the book Deep Work. Cal Newport suggest scheduling every minute of your day.
This is challenging&amp;ndash;it takes training and practice but it has had profound impact on my productivity and well being.
Everyone has a plan &#39;til they are punched in the mouth.--Mike Tyson  Tasks either take longer or get completed quicker than expected thus there is a lot of adjustment to the schedule but it is well worth the effort.</description>

      <description>I hav been using the mutate function in dplyr for about a year now. However, I recently disovered a useful partner in the if_else function.
Ultimately, this is having a big impact on my workflow.
Below is my previous workflow. I would make seperate data frames and then bind the data frames together to run counts on the variables of interests.
lang_success_s &amp;lt;- langarts %&amp;gt;%filter(final &amp;gt;=2, pt_diff &amp;gt;=0)%&amp;gt;% #segment students with a final grade of C or higher and either maintained or increased their grade)mutate(&amp;quot;Success&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;TRUE&amp;quot;) #add variable Successdim(lang_success_s)lang_success_n &amp;lt;- langarts %&amp;gt;%filter(final &amp;gt;=2, pt_diff &amp;lt; 0) %&amp;gt;% #segment students with final Grade C or higher but decreased their grademutate(&amp;quot;Success&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;FALSE&amp;quot;) # add variable Succes and fill in with false.</description>

      <description>I finished reading Deep Work by Cal Newport last month. Mr. Newport puts a framework and rules to what I think we already suspect. The book made me think of two other books Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maitenance and The War of Art. Both of these books put an emphasis on the benefits of craftmanship.
The concept of taking a break from focus rather than distraction is profound and his challenge to quit social media for 30 days benefical.</description>

      <description> An approach to debugging Take the approach that most likely it is your fault that something is not working. You are simply not providing clear enough directions to the computer&amp;ndash;Your computer is simple and has no grit to problem solve your sloppiness.
Be thankful that that the computer is throwing an error rather giving a result that is wrong.
My approach to debugging accounts for the following:
 Data Types Spaces Syntax Errors and missing commas Updated package/library Other silly mistakes  </description>

      <description>Seth Godin published a blog post entititled &amp;ldquo;Is Judgement Involved?&amp;rdquo;. Seth&amp;rsquo;s point is the best jobs involve making decisions and taking responsbility&amp;ndash;hence risk.
I hope you disucss and share this idea; it&amp;rsquo;s still too much of a secret.</description>

      <description>Do you agree that good infrastructure makes your life easier? Have you thought about the infrastructure of managing your program data? What are your systems that are in place to collect, manage and analyze your data?
My experience is that nonprofit organizations do not manage their program data in an optimal way and often manage their data in ways that make it challenging for employees to do their work. My gravest concern is that many nonprofit managers may not even recognize there is a problem.</description>

      <description>I have been thinking a lot about craftsmanship and trying to improve my work habits. I listened to a podcast that featured Vince Vaugn, and I was impressed with Vaughn&amp;rsquo;s story. Vaughn&amp;rsquo;s commitment to the craft of acting came through in the episode. In most cases, we rarely think about the process or the journey people take on their road to success. One aspect that stuck out what his commitment to the process and working to get better at acting.</description>

      <description>One big challenge in rendering the site was using the R studio GUI Git. How many times did I restart my computer before I deduced the problem? The Git process would stall out.
To solve, I used the new Git desktop feature (https://desktop.github.com/) and it worked.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>I have managed nonprofit evaluation projects with Github, Trello, Slack and WorkFlowy. Github and Trello are more for Task managment and there is some redundancy to the process but I make every attempt to integrate these tools.
What I think gets lost with Github, Trello, and Slack is that it is hard to see the entire picture. Workflowy is a narrative of what is going on with a project. The best part is being able to hide and then easily bring back content.</description>

      <description>rmarkdown::render(“file.name”)
The line of code above has dramatically improved my workflow. The render function helped me reach the goal of creating an automated system of creating a status report and share data in a more efficient manner.
Ultimately, I still want to use the makefile feature but this process has helped identify the structure.
Here is a snippet of how the automation works

      <description>I have been working on trying to automate my workflow and want to learn to utilzie a makefile system to run a status report. To be honest, I am struggling to understand what I am reading from the tutorials.
Next step will be to clone the repository and work through the examples.</description>

      <description>Kevin Gilds, MPA The title of this blog is R for the rest of us. The phrase R has a steep learning curve is true, and I hope to assist anyone leap up to R from spreadsheets.
Learning R and basic data science has helped me wrangle nonprofit program data and develop methods to make data processing and reporting easier. I came to R from a unique path&amp;ndash;the social service sector.</description>
