      <title>A bit of a hack</title>

      <description>This week I also finished up a feature of an application that I have been thinking about implementing. I wanted to summarize data entry by site location. The problem is that variable I am trying to summarize is free data entry&amp;ndash;hence many ways to write the name of the school and mispelling. I used a bit of hack with the gsub function.
My approach was this.
site$school &amp;lt;- toupper(site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL MIDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL MAGNET&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL SCHOOL&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELLMIDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL MIDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;BLAKE ACADMY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;BLAKE ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;BLAKEACADMY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;BLAKE ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;BLAKE ACAMAY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;BLAKE ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DREAM ACADENY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DREAM ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;FREEDOM MS&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;FREEDOM MIDDLE SCHOOL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;RIBUALT MDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;RIBAULT MIDDLE&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school)  However, my sense is that there is a better way implment this with regular expressions.</description>

      <description>My intent was to build a data entry application with Python using the flask web environment. Somehow I managed to talk myself into using Shiny with the help of this post from Dean Atalli. It only took me about a couple of distracted hours with 3 kids to get through the tutorial and a morning to update a line of code to get the example working.
The pros to this approach are the following:</description>

      <description>Introduction Most of my work in R is hidden from public view&amp;ndash;this seems like a blessing but is a curse in many respects; I get no feedback on my work in R.
I felt challenged and inspired by David Robinson&amp;rsquo;s post Advice to aspiring data scientist: start a blog
I completed the following analysis while in the midst of Hurricane Irma in September 2017, and I noticed the analysis utilizes many tidyverse functions.</description>

      <description>Writing this blog post on Gaps inspired me to re-read parts of the The Fifth Discipline by Peter Senge.
Gaps are a source of energy and Senge writes creative tension emerges when there is a gap between a person&amp;rsquo;s vision and reality. He uses a rubber band to illustrate that between vision and current reality is tension and the only way to break the tension is move reality toward the vision or move the vision toward reality.</description>

      <description>I keep coming across the concept of gaps&amp;ndash;more specifically the gap between reality and one&amp;rsquo;s vision for how reality should be. I first came across this concept in the Fifth Discipline by Peter Senge.
Currently I am reading Man&amp;rsquo;s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.
This concept also came up in this interview of Ray Dalio that I listened to this week.
Frankl argues that mental health requires tension and the essence of being a human being is to close the gap between what is and what should be.</description>

      <description>This seems basic in retrospect but one of the biggest challenges starting with R was understanding the concept of the working directory. For the most part, I figured the working directory out. However a bad habit that festered was changing the working directory in the chunks of my Rmd files.
Below is how I would configure my R chunks to read data or source scripts/functions. My data sits in multiple folders in the Project Folder, and I could not get the chunk to read the data or source scripts without setting the working directly.</description>

      <description>I finally did it. I bought a refrubished laptop and installed Ubuntu to run R. The only trouble I had was installing R studio. It appears there are some challenges adding outside software on this platform&amp;ndash;Ubuntu 16.4
This article helped me throught the process Install R, R-Studio on Ubuntu
The only adjustment I had to make was to change the verison number of R-Studio I was downloading. Basically you update the version number; in my case instead of downloading 1.</description>

      <description>I am starting on the new year of project and was revisiting some functions. I had a function that created a csv file of duplicate values for every organization that submitted data. The function was useful but a pain to run the function for every organization on separate chunks.
I figured there had to be better way. The following is an incremental improvement to the old process but I do have a sense there is a better way.</description>

      <description>More on the book Deep Work. Cal Newport suggest scheduling every minute of your day.
This is challenging&amp;ndash;it takes training and practice but it has had profound impact on my productivity and well being.
Everyone has a plan &#39;til they are punched in the mouth.--Mike Tyson  Tasks either take longer or get completed quicker than expected thus there is a lot of adjustment to the schedule but it is well worth the effort.</description>

      <description>I hav been using the mutate function in dplyr for about a year now. However, I recently disovered a useful partner in the if_else function.
Ultimately, this is having a big impact on my workflow.
Below is my previous workflow. I would make seperate data frames and then bind the data frames together to run counts on the variables of interests.
lang_success_s &amp;lt;- langarts %&amp;gt;% filter(final &amp;gt;=2, pt_diff &amp;gt;=0)%&amp;gt;% #segment students with a final grade of C or higher and either maintained or increased their grade) mutate(&amp;quot;Success&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;TRUE&amp;quot;) #add variable Success dim(lang_success_s) lang_success_n &amp;lt;- langarts %&amp;gt;% filter(final &amp;gt;=2, pt_diff &amp;lt; 0) %&amp;gt;% #segment students with final Grade C or higher but decreased their grade mutate(&amp;quot;Success&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;FALSE&amp;quot;) # add variable Succes and fill in with false.</description>

      <description>I finished reading Deep Work by Cal Newport last month. Mr. Newport puts a framework and rules to what I think we already suspect. The book made me think of two other books Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maitenance and The War of Art. Both of these books put an emphasis on the benefits of craftmanship.
The concept of taking a break from focus rather than distraction is profound and his challenge to quit social media for 30 days benefical.</description>

      <description> An approach to debugging Take the approach that most likely it is your fault that something is not working. You are simply not providing clear enough directions to the computer&amp;ndash;Your computer is simple and has no grit to problem solve your sloppiness.
Be thankful that that the computer is throwing an error rather giving a result that is wrong.
My approach to debugging accounts for the following:
 Data Types Spaces Syntax Errors and missing commas Updated package/library Other silly mistakes  </description>

      <description>Do you agree that good infrastructure makes your life easier? Have you thought about the infrastructure of managing your program data? What are your systems that are in place to collect, manage and analyze your data?
My experience is that nonprofit organizations do not manage their program data in an optimal way and often manage their data in ways that make it challenging for employees to do their work. My gravest concern is that many nonprofit managers may not even recognize there is a problem.</description>

In most cases, we rarely think about the process or the journey people take on their road to success.

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>I have managed nonprofit evaluation projects with Github, Trello, Slack and WorkFlowy. Github and Trello are more for Task managment and there is some redundancy to the process but I make every attempt to integrate these tools.
What I think gets lost with Github, Trello, and Slack is that it is hard to see the entire picture. Workflowy is a narrative of what is going on with a project. The best part is being able to hide and then easily bring back content.</description>
