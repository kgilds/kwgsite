      <description>I have been focused on modeling system processes. I spotted that Gitlab supported mermaid in its markdown.
It is easy to use and I noticed that it can be used within the R enviornment with the DiagrammR package</description>

      <description>Currently working through a slump. In Good to Great by Jim Collins references the concept of the 20 mile march. This stretch has been cold and boring.
On Sunday, I had great ambitions to re-work and improve a data cleaning process. I have spent 3 hours and 20 minutes over the past few days working through a process of reading data into R.
What I learned is for the next post.</description>

      <description>Today, I listened to Francesca Gino on the Hidden Brain Podcast regarding creative people engaging in positive deviance or breaking the rules for the good of us all.
Like everything it is a balance and it is important to know the rules first and to be open.

      <description>Typically, my habit is to use a Pomodoro tracker. In my haste to finish up a report, I stopped using it last week and just plowed through the work. I stay focused on work for the most part, but I think the work is better when there is a defined starting and ending point.</description>

      <description>My OKR for the end of July was to develop an R package for Get REAL! and complete the summative evaluation report in bookdown.
The Get REAL! package worked like a charm; I see other additional opportunities for additional functions including for plots.
I enjoyed working in Bookdown; my frustration was that the final report needs to be submitted in Microsoft Word. There is too much change that needs to occur between the markdown document and word.</description>

      <description>I am enjoying this new [podcast]https://open.spotify.com/show/334O1au7TzGsZztZTrF9zj?si=318Iy3LgREWjXnOlGosYVQ from Arthur Brooks.
The contention for Brooks is that people argue badly and that the arguments are escalating towards contempt. He points out that arguing and anger can convey caring and can bring people closer together.
This argument feels correct to me and his podcasts have been both practical and powerful.</description>

      <description>Another theme emerging this summer is the importance of asking good questions. The theme first emerged during a leadership lunch with my organization&amp;rsquo;s CEO. Currently, I am reading Benjamin Franklin: An American Life by Walter Isaacson. Isaacson points out the Franklin used questions to disarm others in argument.
I had success with this approach last week, and I hope to keep mindful of this approach.</description>

This afternoon I listened to this podcast with Tim Ferris and Jason Fried. The best part of the conversation pertained to the importance of writing and communicating well. Jason Fried made an asute observation that schools do not teach iteration in writing. I suspect that this is true.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year, I set up an Rmd file with more functions and named the variables more general terms. Hence, I only had to change the name and path of the input file and the name of the output file. Approximately 3.5 hours of work was reduced to 50 minutes. Ultimately, I want to see more the scripts turn into functions, Addin, or Shiny Application.</description>

      <description>I am currently reading Weapons of Math Destruction. I had heard about the book prior and had some reservations, and when I picked it up at the library; I still had a tinge of hesitation. I think my understanding was that this was an anti-data book and this is not the case.
The author Cathy O&amp;rsquo; Neil emphasizes what I strongly believe and that is models and data should be transparent.</description>

      <description>Working with Flexdashboards is great-I had forgotten how much fun they are to work with. The other day I was reviewing some my prior applications, and wanted to reuse Flexboard I built last year.
I brought the file into the new directory and after an overhaul of previous code, I kept running into a strange error. The error message conveyed that the data file was not in the directory. I could see the file in the directory and could successfully run the code chunk.</description>

      <description>Typically I spend around 50-100 minutes per day working on R programming and this is typically planned and focused work. This morning I loosed up my rules&amp;ndash;I did not track my time formally and I listened to Volbeat loudly while I worked. I did this because I knew I was going to have extra time today. It was fun but I could feel my brain straining to think and listen at the same time</description>

      <description>One day, I stopped working on the master branch and started creating new branches, committed the files, pushed the changes, merged into the master, checked back into the master to pull the content back down from the repository. One day it just became a habit.
Speaking of which&amp;ndash;I just finished the The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. I liked the book especially the diagrams throughout the book to model the concept and I like the application of Systems Theory.</description>

I played around with Gitlab issues and project management this morning&amp;ndash;at first I hated it but it started growing on me rapidly&amp;ndash;I started to think about moving over from bitbucket.
This afternoon and tonight, I was a bit obsessed with starting the process of modeling some sales data.</description>

      <description>This morning successfully rendered table in shiny dashboard that reflected the number of matches on the student survey. I was thinking of developing a ggplot that reflected current status and goal or prior years. I am still not jazzed about the data entry tables could you plot it? I think I tried to put the different sources in boxes but it was too much. I am just not sure if it is worth the effort to change now.</description>

      <description>This morning, I worked on laying the infrastructure for adding a match indicator in my Shiny app dashboard. I also updated the match script to send the rds file to the bookdown directory.
My next step is update the server section to render the match information. It may worth considering changing the layout of my table.

      <description>This morning I successfully employed the Forcats package and re_code function to change factor levels for easier plotting and implemented the scales function to display the percent sign.
I like seven point likert scales but I don&amp;rsquo;t like the output of seven point scales on graphs or tables&amp;ndash;especially with a scale like Strongly Disagree through Strongly Agree.
p_relationship &amp;lt;- parent %&amp;gt;% group_by(Time) %&amp;gt;% #Pre and Post variable mutate(positive_relationships = fct_recode(positive_relationships, #recode the levels to make it easier to plot and table display) &amp;quot;Strong Disagreement&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;Strongly Disagree&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Strong Disagreement&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;Disagree&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Slight Disagreement&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;Slightly Disagree&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Neutral&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;Neither Agree/Disagree&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Slight Agreement&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;Slightly Agree&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Strong Agreement&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;Agree&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Strong Agreement&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;Strongly Agree&amp;quot;))  This is going to be a pain for the whole report but not too bad for each sub-section.</description>

I took a look at the parent survey and at this time I will use the functions in the janitor package.

      <description>I was happy to learn that updating a R-package is easy; at least my update this morning was painless. The first time I worked on a package it felt awful.
This morning I worked to fix some issues. I made the necessary changes and re-built the package with ease. Cleaned up the rest of the report; wiped out unnecessary chunks and merged back in with master.
I notice when working with bookdown a lot of files change when you preview.</description>

The warnings from yesterday were able to be addressed.
The param tag needed needed to have the df param right after it. For some reason, I just had dots.
I deleted the \code{function} reference to other functions in the documentation section.
The only concern testing in the real world is that succcess_c did not load in current version of package.</description>

      <description>One new approach is to post worknotes. My hope is that the work notes help generate better content for future articles and projects.
Yesterday 06/02/2018 downloaded updated data and ran all. Think I got teacher and parent survey where I want. Strategy will be put the table as they are now but collapse some of the levels so that graph can be a bit cleaner or focused; currently I would have to run the width wider and the output to word is sub-optimal.</description>

      <description>I came across this article on twitter tonight.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know that I have the expertise to concur or disagree with this article&amp;ndash;I mean the premise is correct being able to solve business problems seems like a &amp;lsquo;no-brainer&amp;rsquo;.
Another important skill is political skills. Sometimes you see what others do not see and you have to sell the vision to the right people.</description>

The book R For Data Science is a great way to learn the fundamentals.

I could not seem to connect my new directory to my bitbucket repository. The problem was that I could not find or seem to create a new branch. The key is knowing that a branch can&amp;rsquo;t be a branch until there is files on the branch.</description>

      <description>I started working on upgrading a markdown report this morning using r forcats and r janitor. Like other renovations this turned into a complete overhaul and did not even get to the fun stuff.
I had to dig into rreadr to update many of the columns to factors. One thing to recall is to knit rather than relying on re-running chunks&amp;ndash;there seems to be something about starting fresh.
Typically investments like these payoff in the long run.</description>

      <description>I was reviewing a markdown document and see an opportunity to incorporate tably functions from the janitor package, and will need the forcats package to set up the infrastructure.
I was able to test out the features of tably and adorn and it made me giddy.
My confession is that I have never used the forcats package but I am excited to learn.</description>

As an aspiring data science, I think it is good to measure progress but I also strongly believe in systems and I like where the author was going. I suspect this may be where the beauty of a well designed OKR&amp;rsquo;s can come into play.</description>

The reverse is the tactical notes on the project&amp;ndash;
I started using this process after reading Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s book Deep Work
I like this process; eventually more detail gets moved to Github issues but I like starting out with the index cards and keeping a physical artifact.</description>

I work with spreadsheet users and I teach and preach tidy data practices all the time.</description>

      <description>My latest foray into writing functions led me to a new learning opportunity.
My first try at this function did not work as expected. The first part of the function worked but the second argument did not take with the mutate statement. The output provided me with a table but did not take my second argument for source.
base_count &amp;lt;- function(df, source){ mutate(df,&amp;quot;Source&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;source&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% count(Source) }  To Stack Overflow I go, and this post helped me out.</description>

      <description>I have been a late bloomer in terms of developing my own tool box of functions and I have finally starting to see the opportunities to use functions and even to write my own packages.
A rule of thumb is that writing a script twice means it is time to write a function; I managed to write a variation of the same script 6 times before it dawned on me this should be a function.</description>

Reactive I knew that I wanted to split the data into school types&amp;ndash;elementary, middle, and high and had a sense that my input value would need to be reactive.</description>

In this podcast, they discuss the future of education. My takeaway from the discussion is that value is found between the balance of automating and the wisdom of humans. The controversy around YouTube and advertisements on Infowars seems to be another case in point where turning your self completely to automation seems risky.
Another, interesting discussion centered around the dynamic between teacher and students.</description>

      <description>It was a struggle for me to learn to write my own functions in R. The moment it did sink in; My though was this&amp;ndash;this is like a Shiny Input and Output.
My two cents is that Shiny should be introduced sooner rather than later for those beginning to learn R.The basis for my assertion is this that learning Shiny helped me conceptualize how make my own functions and added to my computer literacy regarding web development.</description>

      <description>I transitioned from using databases to the RDS format to store evolving data. I ran into some trouble with the RDS format. I was stumped when previous working code would not work on a new data set.
My troubleshooting framework is as follows:
1) Look for silly typos.
2) Check your data types.
3) Isolate the issue.
The str function is the MVP of this troubleshooting adventure with a a little help from isolating the issue.</description>

      <description>I have been ambivalent about using the notebook feature in R studio. I test drove Jupyter Notebooks, and I did not love the experience&amp;ndash;even using R.
However, I have slowly been adopting notebooks into my work flow and here are my use cases for notebooks.
One benefit is testing code or troubleshooting code, I am using in a shiny application.
A second benefit, I have noted with notebooks is that when Preview is selected; the html document will generate and includes the normal output but will also show code that does not work along with the error messages.</description>

      <description>I started the practice of meditating about 2 months ago. I am proud of myself for sticking to it. Some days are better than others but the key is learning that the rep or value is learning to recognize your thoughts have drifted and to come back.
Meditation is not a cure all but it does help you get out of a bad mental state quicker.</description>

      <description>I recall walking into a college orientation and being uncertain if I was in the right room. The reason I was uncertain is because there were more parents in the room than college kids. It never occurred to me to take my parents with me to college orientation. My bias has been that those students who brought their parents with them were doomed to failure. I suspect my bias is wrong&amp;ndash;maybe.</description>

      <description>I listened to a bunch of podcast today but I hardly recall any points. Ok, maybe one point stuck out and that is the value of being bored&amp;ndash;that means maybe not listening to so many podcast in short time frame. Today, the points really had no chance to stick.
This reminds to revisit the exercise of a working meditation while commuting to work.</description>

      <description>Last week, I had a couple of hints from blog posts/podcasts that I should be writing every day. Mostly their work/art prompts makes me want to write more.
I have been impressed with this blog by Austin Kleon and apparently everyone has known about Wait but why
I am determined not to code or write at night as I believe strong that impacts my sleep. I have been effective in getting up every morning writing code for an ongoing project and do not want to give that time up.</description>

      <description>This week I also finished up a feature of an application that I have been thinking about implementing. I wanted to summarize data entry by site location. The problem is that variable I am trying to summarize is free data entry&amp;ndash;hence many ways to write the name of the school and misspelling. I used a bit of hack with the gsub function.
My approach was this.
site$school &amp;lt;- toupper(site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL MIDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL MAGNET&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL SCHOOL&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELLMIDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL MIDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;BLAKE ACADMY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;BLAKE ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;BLAKEACADMY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;BLAKE ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;BLAKE ACAMAY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;BLAKE ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DREAM ACADENY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DREAM ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;FREEDOM MS&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;FREEDOM MIDDLE SCHOOL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;RIBUALT MDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;RIBAULT MIDDLE&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school)  However, my sense is that there is a better way implement this with regular expressions.</description>

      <description>My intent was to build a data entry application with Python using the flask web environment. Somehow I managed to talk myself into using Shiny with the help of this post from Dean Atalli. It only took me about a couple of distracted hours with 3 kids to get through the tutorial and a morning to update a line of code to get the example working.
The pros to this approach are the following:</description>

      <description>Writing this blog post on Gaps inspired me to re-read parts of the The Fifth Discipline by Peter Senge.
Gaps are a source of energy and Senge writes creative tension emerges when there is a gap between a person&amp;rsquo;s vision and reality. He uses a rubber band to illustrate that between vision and current reality is tension and the only way to break the tension is move reality toward the vision or move the vision toward reality.</description>

      <description>I keep coming across the concept of gaps&amp;ndash;more specifically the gap between reality and one&amp;rsquo;s vision for how reality should be. I first came across this concept in the Fifth Discipline by Peter Senge.
Currently I am reading Man&amp;rsquo;s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.
This concept also came up in this interview of Ray Dalio that I listened to this week.
Frankl argues that mental health requires tension and the essence of being a human being is to close the gap between what is and what should be.</description>

      <description>This seems basic in retrospect but one of the biggest challenges starting with R was understanding the concept of the working directory. For the most part, I figured the working directory out. However a bad habit that festered was changing the working directory in the chunks of my Rmd files.
Below is how I would configure my R chunks to read data or source scripts/functions. My data sits in multiple folders in the Project Folder, and I could not get the chunk to read the data or source scripts without setting the working directly.</description>

The only adjustment I had to make was to change the verison number of R-Studio I was downloading. Basically you update the version number; in my case instead of downloading 1.</description>

      <description>I finished reading Deep Work by Cal Newport last month. Mr. Newport puts a framework and rules to what I think we already suspect. The book made me think of two other books Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maitenance and The War of Art. Both of these books put an emphasis on the benefits of craftmanship.
The concept of taking a break from focus rather than distraction is profound and his challenge to quit social media for 30 days benefical.</description>

      <description> An approach to debugging Take the approach that most likely it is your fault that something is not working. You are simply not providing clear enough directions to the computer&amp;ndash;Your computer is simple and has no grit to problem solve your sloppiness.
Be thankful that that the computer is throwing an error rather giving a result that is wrong.

      <description>Do you agree that good infrastructure makes your life easier? Have you thought about the infrastructure of managing your program data? What are your systems that are in place to collect, manage and analyze your data?
My experience is that nonprofit organizations do not manage their program data in an optimal way and often manage their data in ways that make it challenging for employees to do their work. My gravest concern is that many nonprofit managers may not even recognize there is a problem.</description>

 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

What I think gets lost with Github, Trello, and Slack is that it is hard to see the entire picture. Workflowy is a narrative of what is going on with a project. The best part is being able to hide and then easily bring back content.</description>

2018-02-23
Introduction I am interested in school attendance data and found an interesting data set on the Florida Department of Education Website. This seemed like a good time to learn the r readxl package in order to wrangle spreadsheets in the wild. This post closely follows closely with theexamples on the Github Repo.
The file consists of data from a survey of schools in Florida that provides a count of students who were absent more than 21 days in the school year 2015-2016.</description>

      <description>I came across this data set from the Florida Department of Education in March. In Florida school districts are organized by county and I saw this as an opportunity to improve my mapping skills.
This tutorial from Erin C. Anderson was instrumental in being able to complete this project. In fact a lot of the code chunks were stolen.
Data The Florida Department of Education provides data on their website regarding the number of students by school that have missed more than 21 days of school.</description>

Here is a snippet of how the automation works
