      <description> An approach to debugging Take the approach that most likely it is your fault that something is not working. You are simply not providing clear enough directions to the computer&amp;ndash;Your computer is simple and has no grit to problem solve your sloppiness.
Be thankful that that the computer is throwing an error rather giving a result that is wrong.
My approach to debugging accounts for the following:
 Data Types Spaces Syntax Errors and missing commas Updated package/library Other silly mistakes  </description>

      <description>Seth Godin published a blog post entititled &amp;ldquo;Is Judgement Involved?&amp;rdquo;. Seth&amp;rsquo;s point is the best jobs involve making decisions and taking responsbility&amp;ndash;hence risk.
I hope you disucss and share this idea; it&amp;rsquo;s still too much of a secret.</description>

      <description>Do you agree that good infrastructure makes your life easier? Have you thought about the infrastructure of managing your program data? What are your systems that are in place to collect, manage and analyze your data?
My experience is that nonprofit organizations do not manage their program data in an optimal way and often manage their data in ways that make it challenging for employees to do their work. My gravest concern is that many nonprofit managers may not even recognize there is a problem.</description>

      <description>I have been thinking a lot about craftsmanship and trying to improve my work habits. I listened to a podcast that featured Vince Vaugn, and I was impressed with Vaughn&amp;rsquo;s story. Vaughn&amp;rsquo;s commitment to the craft of acting came through in the episode. In most cases, we rarely think about the process or the journey people take on their road to success. One aspect that stuck out what his commitment to the process and working to get better at acting.</description>

      <description>One big challenge in rendering the site was using the R studio GUI Git. How many times did I restart my computer before I deduced the problem? The Git process would stall out.
To solve, I used the new Git desktop feature (https://desktop.github.com/) and it worked.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>I have managed nonprofit evaluation projects with Github, Trello, Slack and WorkFlowy. Github and Trello are more for Task managment and there is some redundancy to the process but I make every attempt to integrate these tools.
What I think gets lost with Github, Trello, and Slack is that it is hard to see the entire picture. Workflowy is a narrative of what is going on with a project. The best part is being able to hide and then easily bring back content.</description>

      <description>rmarkdown::render(“file.name”)
The line of code above has dramatically improved my workflow. The render function helped me reach the goal of creating an automated system of creating a status report and share data in a more efficient manner.
Ultimately, I still want to use the makefile feature but this process has helped identify the structure.
Here is a snippet of how the automation works

      <description>I have been working on trying to automate my workflow and want to learn to utilzie a makefile system to run a status report. To be honest, I am struggling to understand what I am reading from the tutorials.
Next step will be to clone the repository and work through the examples.</description>

      <description>R MarkdownThis is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:
