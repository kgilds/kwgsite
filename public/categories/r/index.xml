      <description>I have been ambivalent about using the notebook feature in R studio. I test drove Jupyter Notebooks, and I did not love the experience&amp;ndash;even using R.
However, I have slowly been adopting notebooks into my work flow and here are my use cases for notebooks.
One benefit is testing code or troubleshooting code, I am using in a shiny application.
A second benefit, I have noted with notebooks is that when Preview is selected; the html document will generate and includes the normal output but will also show code that does not work along with the error messages.</description>

      <title>Shiny for Teaching</title>

      <description>My two cents is that Shiny should be taught to those being introduced to R.
I wrote a script one weekend to process/clean a data set. The script worked but I was unsettled that I was going to have copy this script for another data set. The reason I was unsetteled was because my script was dependent on the data frame I was working on but it did not have to be until the final result.</description>

      <description>I have transitioned from using databases to store evolving data to the Rds format. I finally ran into some trouble with the RDS format. I was stumpted when previous code would not work on this new data.
The str function is the MVP of this troubleshooting adventure. My rule is that when something does not work as expected. 1). Look for silly typos. 2). Check your type of data&amp;ndash;the str function helps you check what type of data you are working with.</description>

      <description>I was writing this morning about the benefits of automation and that even the most simple script is a method of automation. Ironically enough I finished parsing through a spreadsheet in preparation of a meeting and when I finished making copies; a new report was sent to me. This needs a script.</description>

      <description>This week I also finished up a feature of an application that I have been thinking about implementing. I wanted to summarize data entry by site location. The problem is that variable I am trying to summarize is free data entry&amp;ndash;hence many ways to write the name of the school and misspelling. I used a bit of hack with the gsub function.
My approach was this.
site$school &amp;lt;- toupper(site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL MIDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL MAGNET&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL SCHOOL&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELLMIDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL MIDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;BLAKE ACADMY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;BLAKE ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;BLAKEACADMY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;BLAKE ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;BLAKE ACAMAY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;BLAKE ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DREAM ACADENY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DREAM ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;FREEDOM MS&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;FREEDOM MIDDLE SCHOOL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;RIBUALT MDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;RIBAULT MIDDLE&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school)  However, my sense is that there is a better way implement this with regular expressions.</description>

      <description>My intent was to build a data entry application with Python using the flask web environment. Somehow I managed to talk myself into using Shiny with the help of this post from Dean Atalli. It only took me about a couple of distracted hours with 3 kids to get through the tutorial and a morning to update a line of code to get the example working.
The pros to this approach are the following:</description>

      <description>Introduction Most of my work in R is hidden from public view&amp;ndash;this seems like a blessing but is a curse in many respects; I get no feedback on my work in R.
I felt challenged and inspired by David Robinson&amp;rsquo;s post Advice to aspiring data scientist: start a blog
I completed the following analysis while in the midst of Hurricane Irma in September 2017, and I noticed the analysis utilizes many tidyverse functions.</description>

      <description>This seems basic in retrospect but one of the biggest challenges starting with R was understanding the concept of the working directory. For the most part, I figured the working directory out. However a bad habit that festered was changing the working directory in the chunks of my Rmd files.
Below is how I would configure my R chunks to read data or source scripts/functions. My data sits in multiple folders in the Project Folder, and I could not get the chunk to read the data or source scripts without setting the working directly.</description>

      <description>I am starting on the new year of project and was revisiting some functions. I had a function that created a csv file of duplicate values for every organization that submitted data. The function was useful but a pain to run the function for every organization on separate chunks.
I figured there had to be better way. The following is an incremental improvement to the old process but I do have a sense there is a better way.</description>

      <description>I hav been using the mutate function in dplyr for about a year now. However, I recently disovered a useful partner in the if_else function.
Ultimately, this is having a big impact on my workflow.
Below is my previous workflow. I would make seperate data frames and then bind the data frames together to run counts on the variables of interests.
lang_success_s &amp;lt;- langarts %&amp;gt;% filter(final &amp;gt;=2, pt_diff &amp;gt;=0)%&amp;gt;% #segment students with a final grade of C or higher and either maintained or increased their grade) mutate(&amp;quot;Success&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;TRUE&amp;quot;) #add variable Success dim(lang_success_s) lang_success_n &amp;lt;- langarts %&amp;gt;% filter(final &amp;gt;=2, pt_diff &amp;lt; 0) %&amp;gt;% #segment students with final Grade C or higher but decreased their grade mutate(&amp;quot;Success&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;FALSE&amp;quot;) # add variable Succes and fill in with false.</description>

      <description> An approach to debugging Take the approach that most likely it is your fault that something is not working. You are simply not providing clear enough directions to the computer&amp;ndash;Your computer is simple and has no grit to problem solve your sloppiness.
Be thankful that that the computer is throwing an error rather giving a result that is wrong.
My approach to debugging accounts for the following:
 Data Types Spaces Syntax Errors and missing commas Updated package/library Other silly mistakes  </description>

      <description>Do you agree that good infrastructure makes your life easier? Have you thought about the infrastructure of managing your program data? What are your systems that are in place to collect, manage and analyze your data?
My experience is that nonprofit organizations do not manage their program data in an optimal way and often manage their data in ways that make it challenging for employees to do their work. My gravest concern is that many nonprofit managers may not even recognize there is a problem.</description>

      <description>One big challenge in rendering the site was using the R studio GUI Git. How many times did I restart my computer before I deduced the problem? The Git process would stall out.
To solve, I used the new Git desktop feature (https://desktop.github.com/) and it worked.</description>

      <description>I have been working on trying to automate my workflow and want to learn to utilzie a makefile system to run a status report. To be honest, I am struggling to understand what I am reading from the tutorials.
Next step will be to clone the repository and work through the examples.</description>
