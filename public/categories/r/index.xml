      <description>One of the biggest challenges starting with R was understanding the concept of the working directory. This seems crazy in retrospect. However, a bad habit that festered was changing the working directory in the chunks of my Rmd files. I could not figure it how to make R read the data and I simply ignored the warnings.
This fall I read some posts in R-Studio Community on workflow in R and I wanted to incorproate these techniques.</description>

      <description>I am starting on the new year of project and was revisiting some functions. I had a function that created a csv file of duplicate values for every organization that submitted data. The function was useful but a pain to run the function for every organization on separate chunks.
I figured there had to be better way. The following is an incremental improvement to the old process but I do have a sense there is a better way.</description>

      <description> An approach to debugging Take the approach that most likely it is your fault that something is not working. You are simply not providing clear enough directions to the computer&amp;ndash;Your computer is simple and has no grit to problem solve your sloppiness.
Be thankful that that the computer is throwing an error rather giving a result that is wrong.
My approach to debugging accounts for the following:
 Data Types Spaces Syntax Errors and missing commas Updated package/library Other silly mistakes  </description>

      <description>Do you agree that good infrastructure makes your life easier? Have you thought about the infrastructure of managing your program data? What are your systems that are in place to collect, manage and analyze your data?
My experience is that nonprofit organizations do not manage their program data in an optimal way and often manage their data in ways that make it challenging for employees to do their work. My gravest concern is that many nonprofit managers may not even recognize there is a problem.</description>

      <description>One big challenge in rendering the site was using the R studio GUI Git. How many times did I restart my computer before I deduced the problem? The Git process would stall out.
To solve, I used the new Git desktop feature (https://desktop.github.com/) and it worked.</description>

      <description>I have been working on trying to automate my workflow and want to learn to utilzie a makefile system to run a status report. To be honest, I am struggling to understand what I am reading from the tutorials.
Next step will be to clone the repository and work through the examples.</description>
