      <description>I built a Shiny Application to free data from a spreadsheet on the Florida Department of Education website. I learned a lot&amp;ndash;specifically making the input variable reactive, sprinkling in html to make it look how I want, and using the DT package for useful rendering of the data.
Reactive I knew that I wanted to split the data into school types&amp;ndash;elementary, middle, and high and had a sense that my input value would need to be reactive.</description>

      <description>Introduction: I am interested in school attendance data and found an interesting data set on the Florida Department of Education Website. This seemed like a good opportunity to learn the readxl package. This post closely follows with the examples on the Github Repo.
The file consists of a count of students who were absent more than 21 days in the 2015-2016 school year. The data is broken down by school district and school; the data also includes enrollment data and percent of students who missed more than 21 days by school.</description>

      <description>I have struggled with bar plots using ggplot2&amp;ndash; I never bothered to look under the hood to understand what was happening; I just hacked away until I get a reasonable looking bar plot.
This has changed since I signed up for the R4DS community slack group in December and have been working my way slowly through the R for Data Science Book. As, I have been going through Chapter 3, I finally started looking under the hood and learning the fundamentals of gglot2.</description>

      <description>I learned how to use the list.file function from Dean Attali&amp;rsquo;s Post: Mimicking a Google Form with a Shiny App
However the power of the list.file function finally set this in this week. The function is not merely a method to list the files&amp;ndash;it can be a method to put all those files to an object that can be manipulated&amp;ndash;mind blown. ðŸ˜„
Here is my script to combine multiple pdf files using the tabulizer package.</description>

      <description>It was a struggle for me to learn to write my own functions in R. The moment it did sink in; My though was this&amp;ndash;this is like a Shiny Input and Output.
My two cents is that Shiny should be introduced sooner rather than later for those beginning to learn R.The basis for my assertion is this that learning Shiny helped me conceptualize how make my own functions and added to my computer literacy regarding web development.</description>

      <description>I transitioned from using databases to the RDS format to store evolving data. I ran into some trouble with the RDS format. I was stumped when previous working code would not work on a new data set.
My troubleshooting framework is as follows:
1) Look for silly typos.
2) Check your data types.
3) Isolate the issue.
The str function is the MVP of this troubleshooting adventure with a a little help from isolating the issue.</description>

      <description>One reason, I love Rmarkdown is that you can show and check your work. The benefits of rep
2+2  ## [1] 4 My Rmarkdown documents reports were long and somewhat intense. Last summer in R-studo community I came across this thread on how to organize a project. What struck me was the sourcing of scripts to generate Rmarkdown reports. Initially, I had a hard time with this because I could not figure out the working directory [see this post]</description>

      <description>I have been ambivalent about using the notebook feature in R studio. I test drove Jupyter Notebooks, and I did not love the experience&amp;ndash;even using R.
However, I have slowly been adopting notebooks into my work flow and here are my use cases for notebooks.
One benefit is testing code or troubleshooting code, I am using in a shiny application.
A second benefit, I have noted with notebooks is that when Preview is selected; the html document will generate and includes the normal output but will also show code that does not work along with the error messages.</description>

      <description>I was writing this morning about the benefits of automation and that even the most simple script is a method of automation. Ironically enough I finished parsing through a spreadsheet in preparation of a meeting and when I finished making copies; a new report was sent to me. This needs a script.</description>

      <description>This week I also finished up a feature of an application that I have been thinking about implementing. I wanted to summarize data entry by site location. The problem is that variable I am trying to summarize is free data entry&amp;ndash;hence many ways to write the name of the school and misspelling. I used a bit of hack with the gsub function.
My approach was this.
site$school &amp;lt;- toupper(site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL MIDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL MAGNET&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL SCHOOL&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELLMIDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DOWDELL MIDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DOWDELL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;BLAKE ACADMY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;BLAKE ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;BLAKEACADMY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;BLAKE ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;BLAKE ACAMAY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;BLAKE ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;DREAM ACADENY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DREAM ACADEMY&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;FREEDOM MS&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;FREEDOM MIDDLE SCHOOL&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school) site$school &amp;lt;- gsub(&amp;quot;RIBUALT MDDLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;RIBAULT MIDDLE&amp;quot;, fixed=TRUE, site$school)  However, my sense is that there is a better way implement this with regular expressions.</description>

      <description>My intent was to build a data entry application with Python using the flask web environment. Somehow I managed to talk myself into using Shiny with the help of this post from Dean Atalli. It only took me about a couple of distracted hours with 3 kids to get through the tutorial and a morning to update a line of code to get the example working.
The pros to this approach are the following:</description>

      <description>Introduction Most of my work in R is hidden from public view&amp;ndash;this seems like a blessing but is a curse in many respects; I get no feedback on my work in R.
I felt challenged and inspired by David Robinson&amp;rsquo;s post Advice to aspiring data scientist: start a blog
I completed the following analysis while in the midst of Hurricane Irma in September 2017, and I noticed the analysis utilizes many tidyverse functions.</description>

      <description>This seems basic in retrospect but one of the biggest challenges starting with R was understanding the concept of the working directory. For the most part, I figured the working directory out. However a bad habit that festered was changing the working directory in the chunks of my Rmd files.
Below is how I would configure my R chunks to read data or source scripts/functions. My data sits in multiple folders in the Project Folder, and I could not get the chunk to read the data or source scripts without setting the working directly.</description>

      <description>I am starting on the new year of project and was revisiting some functions. I had a function that created a csv file of duplicate values for every organization that submitted data. The function was useful but a pain to run the function for every organization on separate chunks.
I figured there had to be better way. The following is an incremental improvement to the old process but I do have a sense there is a better way.</description>

      <description>I hav been using the mutate function in dplyr for about a year now. However, I recently disovered a useful partner in the if_else function.
Ultimately, this is having a big impact on my workflow.
Below is my previous workflow. I would make seperate data frames and then bind the data frames together to run counts on the variables of interests.
lang_success_s &amp;lt;- langarts %&amp;gt;% filter(final &amp;gt;=2, pt_diff &amp;gt;=0)%&amp;gt;% #segment students with a final grade of C or higher and either maintained or increased their grade) mutate(&amp;quot;Success&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;TRUE&amp;quot;) #add variable Success dim(lang_success_s) lang_success_n &amp;lt;- langarts %&amp;gt;% filter(final &amp;gt;=2, pt_diff &amp;lt; 0) %&amp;gt;% #segment students with final Grade C or higher but decreased their grade mutate(&amp;quot;Success&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;FALSE&amp;quot;) # add variable Succes and fill in with false.</description>

      <description> An approach to debugging Take the approach that most likely it is your fault that something is not working. You are simply not providing clear enough directions to the computer&amp;ndash;Your computer is simple and has no grit to problem solve your sloppiness.
Be thankful that that the computer is throwing an error rather giving a result that is wrong.
My approach to debugging accounts for the following:
 Data Types Spaces Syntax Errors and missing commas Updated package/library Other silly mistakes  </description>

      <description>Do you agree that good infrastructure makes your life easier? Have you thought about the infrastructure of managing your program data? What are your systems that are in place to collect, manage and analyze your data?
My experience is that nonprofit organizations do not manage their program data in an optimal way and often manage their data in ways that make it challenging for employees to do their work. My gravest concern is that many nonprofit managers may not even recognize there is a problem.</description>
