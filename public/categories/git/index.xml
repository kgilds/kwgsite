      <description>I was in the process of trying to burn down a git repo but after other failed attempts&amp;ndash;I determined that I was going to have to learn what I was doing wrong.
I could not seem to connect my new directory to my bitbucket repository. The problem was that I could not find or seem to create a new branch. The key is knowing that a branch can&amp;rsquo;t be a branch until there is files on the branch.</description>

      <description>I read this interesting post from Suzan Baert about getting started with Git/Github. I think recommendation 2 about using a dummy repo to experiment with is key and I would recommend this approach to my younger self. My biggest issue was not having the reps and confidence.
One branch at a time I have been using Git for about three or four years and just in the last month started using branches to make changes on a consistent basis.</description>

      <description>One big challenge in rendering the site was using the R studio GUI Git. How many times did I restart my computer before I deduced the problem? The Git process would stall out.
To solve, I used the new Git desktop feature (https://desktop.github.com/) and it worked.</description>
