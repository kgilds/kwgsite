      <description>One of my favorite non-R bloggers to follow is Austin Kleon. What I love about his blog is that he talks about the craft of writing and being an artist. He has a rule about writing every day.
My writing skill has decreased over the past couple of years; but I suspect it mostly has to with the lack of writing.
It has been a month since my last blog post; my challenge will be to post everyday for 30 days.</description>

      <description>Attended a parent teacher conference this morning. I asked the teacher about the pace of his work and she said it&amp;rsquo;s at Cooper&amp;rsquo;s pace. This means that he is delibrate in his work; it took me nearly 40 years to work at a deliberate pace. did this change</description>

      <description>Last week, I had a couple of hints from blog posts/podcasts that I should be writing every day. Mostly their work/art prompts makes me want to write more.
I have been impressed with this blog by Austin Kleon and apparently everyone has known about Wait but why
I am determined not to code or write at night as I believe strong that impacts my sleep. I have been effective in getting up every morning writing code for an ongoing project and do not want to give that time up.</description>

      <description>More on the book Deep Work. Cal Newport suggest scheduling every minute of your day.
This is challenging&amp;ndash;it takes training and practice but it has had profound impact on my productivity and well being.
Everyone has a plan &#39;til they are punched in the mouth.--Mike Tyson  Tasks either take longer or get completed quicker than expected thus there is a lot of adjustment to the schedule but it is well worth the effort.</description>

      <description>I finished reading Deep Work by Cal Newport last month. Mr. Newport puts a framework and rules to what I think we already suspect. The book made me think of two other books Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maitenance and The War of Art. Both of these books put an emphasis on the benefits of craftmanship.
The concept of taking a break from focus rather than distraction is profound and his challenge to quit social media for 30 days benefical.</description>

      <description>I have been thinking a lot about craftsmanship and trying to improve my work habits. I listened to a podcast that featured Vince Vaugn, and I was impressed with Vaughn&amp;rsquo;s story. Vaughn&amp;rsquo;s commitment to the craft of acting came through in the episode. In most cases, we rarely think about the process or the journey people take on their road to success. One aspect that stuck out what his commitment to the process and working to get better at acting.</description>
