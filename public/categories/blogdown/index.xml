      <description>Yesterday, I was writing about making the distinction between different types of content. For instance some content is fine in the confines of a post and some content would be better filling an entire page.
I have been working through how to organize this content within the confines of my theme. This video is useful in laying the framework to understanding how to structure and display items in the content folder.</description>

      <title>Post vs Project</title>

      <description>I have noticed that most my content displays quite well within the post framework for with this theme. However, at times I want to utilize the full page mode. I know how to do this but I am not positive how to make it look nice. I am going to try hack my way through this and see if I can make this work.
I am strangely loyal to this theme; or too lazy to make a change.</description>

      <description>My post from yesterday included images of both sides of an index card. Apparently, I need the practice of adding images to my posts. I tend to forget to commit the files to the static folder and get stumped for about 10 minutes on why the image does not render online.
Hence a good is excuse to render this gif file.</description>

      <description>I just completed a draft of a post; I am not completely statisfied with the rendered output for a host of reasons. My current theme has a left side-bar and for this piece I think the sidebar inhibits the conent&amp;ndash;I suspect the content would look better with an entire page.</description>

      <description>One big challenge in rendering the site was using the R studio GUI Git. How many times did I restart my computer before I deduced the problem? The Git process would stall out.
To solve, I used the new Git desktop feature (https://desktop.github.com/) and it worked.</description>

      <description>Is the cure worse than the disease is what I pondered after I fixed an issue with Disqus comments.
I could not figure out how to get the Disqus Comment section to render on this site.
The fix for addressing the Disqus issues was changing the baseurl parameter from &amp;ldquo;/&amp;rdquo; to the name of the website in the confg.toml file. This Github Issue helped me resolve.
Before
baseurl= &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;  The fix</description>
