      <description>I have been a late bloomer in terms of developing my own tool box of functions and I have finally starting to see the opportunities to use functions and even to write my own packages.
A rule of thumb is that writing a script twice means it is time to write a function; I managed to write a variation of the same script 6 times before it dawned on me this should be a function.</description>

      <description>I am starting on the new year of project and was revisiting some functions. I had a function that created a csv file of duplicate values for every organization that submitted data. The function was useful but a pain to run the function for every organization on separate chunks.
I figured there had to be better way. The following is an incremental improvement to the old process but I do have a sense there is a better way.</description>
