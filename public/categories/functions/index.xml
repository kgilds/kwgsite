      <description>My latest foray into writing functions led me to a new learning opportunity.
My first try at this function did not work as expected. The first part of the function worked but the second argument did not take with the mutate statement. The output provided me with a table but did not take my second argument for source.
base_count &amp;lt;- function(df, source){ mutate(df,&amp;quot;Source&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;source&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% count(Source) }  To Stack Overflow I go, and this post helped me out.</description>

      <description>I have been a late bloomer in terms of developing my own tool box of functions and I have finally starting to see the opportunities to use functions and even to write my own packages.
A rule of thumb is that writing a script twice means it is time to write a function; I managed to write a variation of the same script 6 times before it dawned on me this should be a function.</description>

      <description>I am starting on the new year of project and was revisiting some functions. I had a function that created a csv file of duplicate values for every organization that submitted data. The function was useful but a pain to run the function for every organization on separate chunks.
I figured there had to be better way. The following is an incremental improvement to the old process but I do have a sense there is a better way.</description>
