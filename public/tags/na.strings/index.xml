      <description>na. strings The argument na.string= &amp;quot;&amp;quot; saved me a lot of work today. Happy I came across this in Stack Over Flow relatively quickly.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24172111/change-the-blank-cells-to-na.
My data set apparently has hidden spaces and the na.omit function was not removing these observations. As a result, my factor levels were messed up and my table summaries were awful.
It is fun to learn new things.</description>
