      <description>One new approach is to post worknotes. My hope is that the work notes help generate better content for future articles and projects.
Yesterday 06/02/2018 downloaded updated data and ran all. Think I got teacher and parent survey where I want. Strategy will be put the table as they are now but collapse some of the levels so that graph can be a bit cleaner or focused; currently I would have to run the width wider and the output to word is sub-optimal.</description>
