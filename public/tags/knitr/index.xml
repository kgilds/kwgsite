      <description>Special moments Last Saturday, I spent a couple of hours troubleshooting why I could not successfully render an image in my markdown file. I put the concern has an issue on my Github repository. I was using forward and back slashes, changing the working directory. I was thinking about funny tweets to send about this, I was looking on Stack Overflow.
While driving around with my wife and kids to pick up produce it dawned on me; I should not be putting the script in a chunk as it is not r code.</description>
