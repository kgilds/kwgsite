      <description>One of the biggest challenges starting with R was understanding the concept of the working directory. This seems crazy in retrospect. However, a bad habit that festered was changing the working directory in the chunks of my Rmd files. I could not figure it how to make R read the data and I simply ignored the warnings.
This fall I read some posts in R-Studio Community on workflow in R and I wanted to incorproate these techniques.</description>
