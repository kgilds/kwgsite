      <description>This seems basic in retrospect but one of the biggest challenges starting with R was understanding the concept of the working directory. For the most part, I figured the working directory out. However a bad habit that festered was changing the working directory in the chunks of my Rmd files.
Below is how I would configure my R chunks to read data or source scripts/functions. My data sits in multiple folders in the Project Folder, and I could not get the chunk to read the data or source scripts without setting the working directly.</description>
