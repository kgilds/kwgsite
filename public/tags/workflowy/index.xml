      <description>I have managed nonprofit evaluation projects with Github, Trello, Slack and WorkFlowy. Github and Trello are more for Task managment and there is some redundancy to the process but I make every attempt to integrate these tools.
What I think gets lost with Github, Trello, and Slack is that it is hard to see the entire picture. Workflowy is a narrative of what is going on with a project. The best part is being able to hide and then easily bring back content.</description>
